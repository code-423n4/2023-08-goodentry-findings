Inside `GeVault.sol` ticks.length is accessed multiple times in pushTick(),shiftTick(),getReserves(),removeFromAllTicks(),getTVL(),getActiveTickIndex().As ticks.length's value is already stored inside `len` variable inside the getTickLength() function.using this `len` variable will reduce gas consumption as the value will be accessed only from the variable rather than the blockchain which is gas costly.
