1. There is an unnecessary duplication of the `TokenisableRange(tr)` function call when pushing a new tick to the` ticks` array. 

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/GeVault.sol#L117-L122

It can be optimized by calling the function once and storing the result in a variable, like this:

    TokenisableRange tr = TokenisableRange(lowerTick, upperTick);
    bool baseTokenIsToken0 = tr.baseTokenIsToken0();
    // ...
    else {
    // Check that tick is properly ordered
    bool isOverlap;
    if (baseTokenIsToken0)
       isOverlap = (t.lowerTick() <= ticks[ticks.length-1].upperTick());
    else
       isOverlap = (t.upperTick() >= ticks[ticks.length-1].lowerTick());
    
    require(!isOverlap, "GEV: Push Tick Overlap");

    ticks.push(t);
  }
``

By storing the result of the `TokenisableRange `function in the tr variable and the result of the overlap check in the `isOverlap `variable, we avoid unnecessary function calls and streamline the code.

Approval Check before transferring the user's tokens to the contract.

Before transferring the user's tokens to the contract, it is advisable to verify if the user has approved the contract to spend the specified amount of tokens on their behalf. 

The allowance check ensures that the contract is authorized to spend a specific amount of tokens on behalf of the user. Before transferring the tokens from the caller's account, you should confirm that the user has approved the contract to spend the specified amount. This helps prevent any unauthorized transfers and ensures that the contract stays within the allowed spending limits set by the user.

Proposed fix: 
`require(Token(token).allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= amount, "Insufficient allowance");`


This code checks if the contract has been granted an allowance of at least the specified amount by the caller (msg.sender), using the allowance function provided by the token contract. If the allowance is not sufficient, the function will revert with an error message.
