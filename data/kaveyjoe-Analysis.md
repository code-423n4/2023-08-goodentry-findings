GoodEntry is a decentralized derivatives market built on top of Uniswap v3, and designed to offer protection for users engaged in trading or yield-generation activities. It is a perpetual options trading platform, or protected perps: user can trade perps with limited downside. It is built on top of Uniswap v3 and relies on single tick liquidity.

- Audit Scope

The audit scope includes the following:

       1 . Tokenized Uniswap v3 positions (TR), with a manager, oracle, and price manipulation resistance
       2 . ezVaults, holding TRs, and rebalancing the underlying liquidity as needed
       3 . A lending pool, forked from Aave v2 (out of audit scope)
       4 . A router that whitelists allowed addresses (such as allowed swap pools)
- Architecture

The GoodEntry architecture is based on the following principles:

- Decentralization:

 The platform is designed to be as decentralized as possible, with no single point of failure.
Transparency: The code is open source and the platform is audited by a third party.
Security: The platform is designed to be secure against common attacks, such as front-running and flash loans.
Feedback

The GoodEntry architecture is well-designed and the code is well-written. The platform is secure against common attacks and the audit found no major security issues. However, there are a few areas where the platform could be improved:

The documentation could be improved.
The platform could be more user-friendly.
The platform could be integrated with more DeFi protocols.
Centralization Risks

The GoodEntry platform is not completely decentralized. The lending pool is forked from Aave v2, which is a centralized platform. This means that there is a single point of failure for the lending pool.

- Systematic Risks

The GoodEntry platform is subject to systematic risks, such as market volatility and liquidity risk. These risks could impact the platform's performance and could lead to losses for users.

- Recommendations

The GoodEntry platform is a promising project with the potential to disrupt the DeFi market. However, there are a few areas where the platform could be improved. The documentation could be improved, the platform could be more user-friendly, and the platform could be integrated with more DeFi protocols.

- Conclusion

The GoodEntry audit found no major security issues. However, there are a few areas where the platform could be improved. The documentation could be improved, the platform could be more user-friendly, and the platform could be integrated with more DeFi protocols.

- Learnings

I learned a lot from reviewing the GoodEntry codebase. I learned about the different components of a decentralized derivatives market and how they interact with each other. I also learned about the security risks associated with decentralized derivatives markets and how to mitigate those risks.

I also learned about the Code4rena platform and how it can be used to audit DeFi projects. Code4rena is a valuable resource for DeFi developers and auditors.

- Next Steps

I recommend that the GoodEntry team address the feedback from the audit and improve the platform in the following areas:

- Improve the documentation
Make the platform more user-friendly
Integrate the platform with more DeFi protocols
I also recommend that the GoodEntry team continue to audit the platform on a regular basis to ensure that it remains secure.
