According to the comment above the if statement, the contract should only send the fees if its 1% of the current balance, but the math is incorrect, it will transfer any fees, even if its 0,01% or less more than of the balance.
The code should instead compare the fee0 > bal0 + bal0/100; fee1 > bal1 + bal1/100, or in other words, the current balance + 1 percent of the current balance (101%).
