   * ```Protected Perps:```
   Protected perpetual is a product that allows traders to take long or short positions without being liquidated by price. This means when the market price falls dramatically, traders will not have their positions liquidated by price, and neither do they take negative P&L.
   ```Example:```
   Trader opened a position for 8 hours at $1,900 activation price. If the market price dropped from $1,831 to $1,771 at that time, ```the trader lost 0.04% instead of getting a 3% loss```. These losses are negligible compared to the actual losses had a stop loss kicked in.

   * ```EzVaults:```
    ezVaults offer a user-friendly ```‚Äúset-and-forget‚Äù``` strategy for yield farmers to earn passive income generated from real yield sources. The primary sources of yield generation are from positions deposited in Automated Market Makers (AMM) when traders swap in positions. Users can deposit and withdraw their assets from ezVaults whenever they want, providing flexibility and control over their liquidity supply.
   ```To start earning passive income with ezVaults, users can follow these steps:```

     ```Selecting an ezVault:``` Click on the product card within the platform to choose an ezVault to take part in. It is recommended to select an ezVault for an asset that you have a long-term bullish outlook on because this could affect the yield potential throughout.
     ```Deposit:``` Users can deposit their liquidity at any point in time. There are no restrictions on this in any way, review the associated deposit fees. These fees may vary depending on the asset type and the current balance of the ezVault.
     ```Withdrawal:``` Depending on the amount of available liquidity in the ticks, users can withdraw their liquidity at any time. Users are permitted to withdraw their principal liquidity as well as any additional swap costs, borrow fees, and token returns that were earned. A dynamic withdrawal fee that ranges from 0.1% to 0.3% is applied, depending on the composition of the ezVault.

   * ```Tokenomics and Rewards:``` 
   ```Genesis Allocation:``` 
   15% of tokens sold in the Initial Farm Offering (IFO) to raise funds for liquidity and development.
      ```Pre-Mining Program:```
   5% of tokens are created upfront and distributed gradually over six months.
      ```$GOOD Token Distribution:```
   25% through Liquidity Mining over three years (earn tokens by providing liquidity).
   15% for partnerships with other projects.
   5% for Season 1 participants with a 3-month cliff and 9-month linear lockup.
   ```Future Seasons:``` Pre-mined tokens released seasonally.
   18% held in reserves for various ecosystem functions.
