I've done mostly code review, even though this contest is the first one when I actually wrote some tests from scratch to better understand the code and the context around it.

This was my first time dealing with Uniswap V3 and concentrated liquidity in general, it's been a while I wanted to get some understanding of it, so I am very much grateful for having had a good excuse this time around.

Because I spent SO MUCH time learning & figuring stuff out, I was somewhat ineffective, and ended up not making it to review at all `OptionsPositionManager` and do much more than scratch the surface of `GeVault`.

As usual, looking forward to getting some feedback on the submissions.
