## `GeVault.withdraw()` does not check if the `token ` is valid, it may lead to some unexpected results

## Too much hardcoding on slippage protection

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/main/contracts/PositionManager/OptionsPositionManager.sol#L477

Although these protections are meaningful, if some unforeseen circumstances such as large price fluctuations occur, users may not be able to withdraw money. 
Therefore, I suggest that the user specify the slippage value. If the user does not specify it, the contract will set it to the default value. This is a more friendly function
