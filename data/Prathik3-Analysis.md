## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
I did a manual review of the code. Used VsCode,Remix and Github for understanding and evaluating the codebase.

## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase
Learnt Basics of uniswap and got a brief idea about how token swaps work in the background.Also the automated findings output helped me a lot to learn the best practices to write smart contracts.

## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
This was my 1st audit.
