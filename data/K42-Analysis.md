## Advanced Analysis Report for [GoodEntry](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry) by K42
### Overview 
- [GoodEntry](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry) is a decentralized derivatives market built on top of Uniswap v3, designed to offer protection for users engaged in trading or yield-generation activities. It introduces a novel concept of "protected perps", allowing users to trade perpetual options with limited downside. The platform leverages single tick liquidity in Uniswap, which behaves as a limit order, whose payout is similar to writing an option. Borrowing such liquidity and removing it from the tick gives a payout similar to buying an option.

### Understanding the Ecosystem:
- [GoodEntry](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry) is designed to foster a cohesive community where members work in conjunction with a core-contributor team led by Kisugi (@JMY0x) to build a thriving ecosystem. The ecosystem is underpinned by a unique tokenomics model that is designed to incentivize participation and ensure the sustainability of the platform.

The tokenomics model is structured as follows:

- Initial Farm Offering (IFO): 15% of the tokens are allocated during the public launch via an IFO. The proceeds from this offering contribute to Protocol Owned Liquidity, with fees supporting protocol development. The token launch date will be announced first on the [GoodEntry](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry) Discord server.

- Pre-Mining Program: 5% of the tokens are allocated to a pre-mining program, which will be distributed linearly over six months. Details of the program mechanics will be released first on the [GoodEntry](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry) Discord server.

- Liquidity Mining: 25% of the tokens are dedicated to liquidity mining over three years. This is designed to incentivize users to provide liquidity to the platform.

- Partnerships: 15% of the tokens are allocated for partnerships. This allocation could be used to form strategic alliances with other platforms or entities.

- Seasonal Allocation: 5% of the tokens are designated for Season 1, with a 3-month cliff followed by a 9-month linear lockup. Future seasons will see pre-mined tokens sent to a multisig wallet, released on a seasonal basis.

- Reserves: 18% of the tokens are held in reserves, pre-minted to a multisig wallet. These reserves can be used for various functions to support the growth and stability of the platform.

- Team Allocation: 22% of the tokens are assigned to the team, subject to a 1-year cliff and a 3-year linear unlock. This ensures that the team is incentivized to continue developing and improving the platform over the long term.

- The [GoodEntry](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry) ecosystem is thus designed to be both inclusive and sustainable, with a clear focus on community collaboration and long-term growth. The tokenomics model plays a crucial role in this, providing the necessary incentives for users to participate in the ecosystem and contribute to its development.

- The platform introduces a unique tokenomics model, with two tokens: ``$GE`` and ``$GEP``. ``$GE`` is the governance token, used for voting on proposals and earning fees from the platform. ``$GEP`` is the protocol token, used for staking, liquidity mining, and earning rewards.

### Codebase Quality Analysis: 
- The codebase is well-structured and modular, with clear separation of concerns among different contracts. The contracts are well-documented, with clear comments explaining the functionality of each function and module. The project uses Brownie as a testing framework, and the tests cover a wide range of scenarios and edge cases. The codebase also includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests, which demonstrates a commitment to quality and robustness.

### Architecture Recommendations: 
The architecture of the platform is sound, with a clear separation of concerns and modular design. However, there are a few areas where improvements could be made:

- Implementing more granular access controls: Currently, some contracts have privileged access to the lending pools. Implementing more granular access controls could help mitigate potential security risks.
- Enhancing price manipulation resistance: While the platform has mechanisms in place to resist price manipulation, these could be further enhanced to ensure robustness against sophisticated attacks.
- Improving gas efficiency: Some operations, such as rebalancing liquidity in [ezVaults](https://gitbook.goodentry.io/ezvaults), could potentially be optimized for gas efficiency. 

### Centralization Risks: 
- The platform has some degree of centralization, with the [GoodEntry](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry) team determining the increments for each asset in the [ezVaults](https://gitbook.goodentry.io/ezvaults). However, this is mitigated by the use of the ``$GE`` governance token, which allows token holders to vote on proposals and influence the direction of the platform.

### Mechanism Review: 
- The mechanisms of the platform, including the protected perps, tokenized Uniswap v3 positions, and [ezVaults](https://gitbook.goodentry.io/ezvaults), are innovative and well-designed. They offer unique benefits to users, such as the ability to trade perpetual options with limited downside and earn swap fees from liquidity provision. 

### Systemic Risks: 
- The platform faces systemic risks common to all DeFi platforms, such as smart contract bugs, oracle failures, and economic attacks. However, these risks are mitigated through a combination of thorough testing, external audits, and robust design principles.

### Areas of Concern

- Centralization risks due to the [GoodEntry](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry) team determining the increments for each asset.
- Potential for gas inefficiencies in operations such as rebalancing liquidity.
- Systemic risks common to all DeFi platforms, such as smart contract bugs and economic attacks.

### Codebase Analysis
- The codebase is well-structured and modular, with clear separation of concerns among different contracts. The contracts are well-documented, with clear comments explaining the functionality of each function and module. The project uses Brownie as a testing framework, and the tests cover a wide range of scenarios and edge cases.

### Recommendations
- Implement more granular access controls to mitigate potential security risks.
- Enhance price manipulation resistance mechanisms to ensure robustness against sophisticated attacks.
- Optimize operations for gas efficiency where possible.
