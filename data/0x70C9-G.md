## LENDING_POOL can be immutable
Github -> https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/main/contracts/RangeManager.sol#L27
LENDING_POOL in RangeManager can never be changed post-deployment, so it can be declared immutable.

## One of the step checks in removeFromStep can be removed.
Github -> https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/main/contracts/RangeManager.sol#L108
Function `RangeManager.removeFromStep` performs the following check:
```
require(step < tokenisedRanges.length && step < tokenisedTicker.length, "Invalid step");
```
One of the AND branches can be removed, because `tokenisedRanges` and `tokenisedTicker` will always have the same length.

## Assigning poolId before push avoids subtraction
Github -> https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/main/contracts/RoeRouter.sol#L76-L77
After a new pool is pushed in `RoeRouter.addPool`, `poolId` is assigned `length - 1`. If we assign `poolId` before the push, we don't need to perform the subtraction.
