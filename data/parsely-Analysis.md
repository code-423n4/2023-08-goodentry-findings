## Comments
The code is very clean and well documented. The design decisions are well commented and how to reference other information was quite easy to find. The project documentation online was very helpful

## Approach taken
- Reading of the codebase
- Checking access control
- Checking logic
- Checking array length checks
- Checking variable setting and usage
- Checking for Reenetrancy and possible donation attack vectors
- Checking if statements and require statements for correct usage of  "||" and  "&&" operators
- Looking up suspected issues in Solodit to verify if they were indeed issues.
- Reading all documentation mentioned
- Reading of known-findings
- Reading of previous audit report
- Ran mainnet fork tests

## Architecture
From what I could see all architecture choices have been made for valid reasons and are well thought out.

## Codebase Quality
Very good

## Centralization risk
Not a heightened risk in my opinion.

## Systemic Risk
Nothing I can think of to comment about systemic risk.
