GoodEntry is a perpetual options trading platform built on top of Uniswap v3. It uses a novel approach to options trading that allows users to trade perps with limited downside.

The protocol is composed of a number of smart contracts, including:

* TokenizedUniswapv3Positions (TRs)
* ezVaults
* A lending pool
* A router that whitelists allowed addresses

The TRs are ERC-20 tokens that represent single tick liquidity in Uniswap v3. They can be used to trade perps with limited downside.

The ezVaults are smart contracts that hold TRs and rebalance the underlying liquidity as needed.

The lending pool is a fork of Aave v2. It allows users to borrow TRs and remove them from the tick, giving them a payout similar to buying an option.

The router is a smart contract that whitelists allowed addresses. This is used to prevent unauthorized access to the protocol.

The protocol has a number of potential benefits, including:

* Limited downside: Users can trade perps with limited downside by using TRs.
* Liquidity: The protocol uses Uniswap v3, which provides deep liquidity.
* Scalability: The protocol is designed to be scalable.

However, the protocol also has a number of potential risks, including:

* Centralization: The protocol is centralized around the lending pool.
* Systemic risk: The protocol is vulnerable to systemic risk, such as a black swan event.

Overall, GoodEntry is a promising protocol with the potential to revolutionize options trading. However, it is important to be aware of the risks involved before using the protocol.

Here are some specific areas that I would like to address in my analysis:

* The use of a centralized lending pool. This is a potential risk, as it could lead to censorship or other problems.
* The use of Chainlink oracles. This is a new technology, and there is some risk of oracle manipulation.
* The scalability of the protocol. The protocol is designed to be scalable, but it is important to monitor the scalability as the protocol grows.
